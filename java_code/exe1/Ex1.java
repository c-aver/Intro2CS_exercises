/*
 * I don't understand why you asked for the first exercise to be included here, but here it is:
GPCD(a, b)
1.	Input(a > 1, b >1)		// receive two integers that are >1 (1 does not have prime divisors)
2.	min = a, max = b		// assume a is the lower of the numbers
3.	If (b < a)			// if assumption is incorrect
	3.1.	min = b, max = a	// set the max and min accordingly
4.	r = max % min		// take the remainder of the division of the two numbers, when it is 0 min is the GCD
5.	while (r != 0)		// iterate until min is the GCD
	5.1.	max = min		// take the min as the next number to divide
	5.2.	min = r			// take the remainder as the next divisor
	5.3.	r = max % min	// recalculate the remainder
6.	gpcd = min			// our first candidate for GPCD is the last number which did not leave a remainder (the GCD)
7.	i = 1				// the first number for GCD checking, we will never actually try to divide by 1
8.	while (gpcd != i++)		// we will try to divide our candidate as long as we did not reach it, the i++ ordering is important here since we are first checking if gpcd was found in our last loop (or is 1 if it is the first loop) and only then incrementing it for the next try
	8.1.	while (gpcd % i == 0 && gpcd != i)	// iterate while GPCD candidate is divisible by i (which means it is not prime), ideally i would only go through prime numbers, but it doesnâ€™t matter since composite numbers will never divide gpcd, this is because it was already divided by all lower numbers (which include their prime divisors), also checking that gpcd did not already reach i, in which case it is the answer
		8.1.1.	gpcd /= i		// divide our candidate by i, eliminating a prime divisor which is not the greatest
9.	return gpcd			// after exiting the loop gcpd will be equal to i which means it is the only divisor (since we divided it by all lower numbers) and is thus a prime and the GPCD
						// note that we never lost gpcd as a GCD of a and b since we only divided it, and every divisor of a CD of a and b is also a CD of a and b
